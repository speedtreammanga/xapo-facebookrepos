_Xapo Github Repos_ is just a small project displaying the GitHub repos of users or orgs as well as a few details and a list of their contributors.

The code is ready to fetch details about `users` and `orgs` but there is no ui elements to help the user choose between `orgs` and `users` as well as type in the account name. For this reason, we're only fetching repo info about the `facebook org`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
